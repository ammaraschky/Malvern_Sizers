# Malvern_Sizers

This repo is dedicated to processing Malvern particle size data using R.

The scripts hosted here do the following: 

- <b> pk1.vol.R </b> determines the diameter at the greatest percent by volume 
from the size data using max.col() and a good deal of subsetting.
- <b> pk.sizr.R </b> aggregates sizes determined by pk1.vol(), taking the median 
and returning a matrix of peak sizes at each temperature.
- <b> uvDplot.R </b> plots UV absorbance data along with diameter. The two plots
depend on two functions: uv.plot() and pk1.vol(). 
- <b> uv.plot.R </b> is a simple xyplot() of the type line. It is used on UV absorbance
data generated by the Shimadzu UV-1800. 
- <b> size dependence plots.R </b> are script files that generate the diameter
vs. concentration graphs. 

The functions and scripts here were designed to work with files exported
from the Malvern software using the method 'Adam exporter'. It is configured to
export these data in this order:

1. Sizes
2. Temperature
3. Derived Count Rate
4. Intensities
5. Volumes
6. Type
7. Sample Name
8. Measurement Data and Time
9. Measurement Position
10. Attenuation Factor
